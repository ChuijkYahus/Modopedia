BREAKING CHANGES:
- CHANGED: BookTypes now use a dispatch codec and the screen factory is separate. The `type` field in your book.json needs to be updated accordingly, check the documentation.
- CHANGED: `modopedia:shapeless_recipe` and `modopedia:shaped_recipe` templates have been merged into `modopedia:crafting_table_recipe`.
- I hope there will be no more breaking changes needed from now on :)


- ADDED: "Study" keybind to open a book to the entry an item belongs to. Similar to Create's ponder.
- ADDED: Multiblock page components now have a `view_angle` key to change the viewing perspective. Default is 30 degrees (isometric).
- ADDED: Commands for opening books, categories and entries. Start with /modopedia.
- ADDED: Item hover text formatting tag.
- ADDED: Internal link text formatting tags.
- ADDED: Holding shift while pressing the back button will take you to the landing page.

- FIXED: Multiblock page components pivot around the wrong point.
