- CHANGED: Cooking and double cooking page templates now use the title "Cooking Recipe" instead of "Recipe"
- CHANGED: Entity/Multiblock page templates (and by extension block pages) now automatically set their width to the width of the page. The `width` field they use has been removed.

- FIXED: Page Components which use a widget (e.g. image gallery buttons) do not create their widget when used as part of a template.
