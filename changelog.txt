- ADDED: Categories and entries now have an `advancement` key to specify an advancement required to unlock content. This will not prevent the content from being accessed directly via a command or code.
- ADDED: `modopedia:classic`, `modopedia:pamphlet` and `modopedia:page` book types now have a `locked_view_type` field to specify how they render locked categories and entries. This can be:
  - ``"hidden"` do not render the locked content
  - `"translucent"` render the content grayed out and inaccessible

- FIXED: Study can take you to the entry you're already on infinitely.
- FIXED: Studying an item with no association inside a book will crash.
