IMPORTANT: The `modopedia:item` component has been deprecated and marked for removal in 1.21.2. It will be replaced by the new `modopedia:item_gallery` component which offers better flexibility.

- ADDED: `FormattedTextBuilder` for use in datagen.
- ADDED: `modopedia:item_gallery` component, this replaces the now deprecated `modopedia:item` component. See documentation for how to use this, it's very different.
- ADDED: `BookRenderContext#renderItem` method. This should be used in place of traditional item rendering as it handles the Study keybind.

- CHANGED: URL text formatters now display the URL on a tooltip.

- FIXED: Books with no subtitle will crash when trying to render their tooltip.
