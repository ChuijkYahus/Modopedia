## Introduction

Modopedia is a data-driven guidebook and in-game documentation mod for Minecraft available on Neoforge and Fabric. It
features an extensive API and a wide range of out-of-the-box content.

**Disclaimer:** While most of the mod is covered by the wiki, some API features for mod developers may not have their own pages. You are expected to be able to read the javadocs and interpret the code on your own for those cases.

## Getting Started

### Installation

If you're a user or modpack developer, please refer to Modopedia's [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modopedia) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modopedia) pages.

For mod developers, go to [[Environment Setup]]

### Prerequisites

This documentation expects you to have passing knowledge of a few prerequisites before attempting to use the mod:

* A decent text editor, for example Visual Studio Code. I highly advise against using something like Notepad as it won't have support for JSON syntax highlighting.
* Knowledge of the basic structure of Minecraft's [Datapacks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack) and [Resource Packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack).
* Knowledge of basic JSON syntax.

<summary>For mod developers</summary>

* You'll need to be able to navigate the API yourself, this documentation outlines the basic installation process and features available, but all the details will be in the JavaDocs on the API classes.

</details>

### Data Types

Some components will use non-JSON data types with their own restrictions and rules such as FString or HString. These types are as follows:

| Type    | Description                                                                                                    |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FString | Formattable String, this is a string which supports Modopedia's [[Text Formatting]] tags.                      |
| HString | Hex String, a 6 digit hexadecimal number represented as a string, without a hash. e.g, "FF0000" is bright red. |
| *[]     | Any data type followed by [] is an array of that type.                                                         |

If the default value of a field is marked as an asterisk *, check the description as it isn't as simple as just a value.

### Create your first Book
