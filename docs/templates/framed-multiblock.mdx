## Description
A **[Multiblock Display](../page_components/multiblock)** with a **[Medium](../page_components/medium-frame)** or **[Large](../page_components/large-frame)** frame. This template is placed so that the multiblock is at (0, 0), and the frame is automatically spaced to fit that.

## JSON Schema

<Callout variant="warning">
    Changing `width` will not scale the size of the frame widgets, it will only change the size of the multiblock itself. If you want a different sized frame, you'll have to make one yourself.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="warning">
    Must have either **`multiblock_id` or `multiblock`**, if both are present the ID will be prioritised.
</Callout>
