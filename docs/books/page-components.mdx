title: Page Components
---

**Page Components** are the most basic building block of a Modopedia book, used to add content to a page. Modopedia provides a variety of built-in components for you to use in your books, all of them have different JSON schemas which are documented below.

Every component has a number of fields which can be used to configure it. Each of these fields should be included as a key value pair on the JSON Object for the component.

### Positions
Every page component in Modopedia can have a position, which is where it gets placed on the Page with (0, 0) being the top left corner of the page. These coordinates are in pixel space.

| ID | Type    | Required | Default | Description                              |
|----|---------|----------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| x  | Integer | &cross;  | 0       | X position of the component on the page. |
| y  | Integer | &cross;  | 0       | Y position of the component on the page. |

### Built-in Page Components
Modopedia comes with a large variety of built-in Page Components, there's too many to list on this page so they all have their own pages in the Page Components section on the sidebar.
